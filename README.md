# A Comparative Analysis of BERT and RoBERTa Model for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Text

NLP transformers are widely used in sentiment analysis tasks. In this research, we analyze BERT and RoBERTa models in performing sentiment analysis. The purpose of this research is to know the pros and cons of the both models and the best method possible to achieve the best results. This research focuses more on analyzing the effect of hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, epoch, and batch size) of both models in regards to their accuracy and validation accuracy.
